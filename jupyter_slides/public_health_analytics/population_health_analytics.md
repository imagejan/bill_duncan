# **Population Health; a Definition**

*   As interpreted by David Kindig, Population Health is:

*   An effort to understand the factors that define the health of populations (Evans, et al.,1994)
*   The non-clinical underlying forces that form the underlying premise upon which the health of populations is based (Frank, J., DATE)

*   Social determinants of health

*   An increased focus on health outcomes (Health Canada)

## Kindig, 2003

# **Kindig’s Definition of Population Health**

## The aggregate health outcome of health adjusted life expectancy (quantity and quality) of a group of individuals, in an economic framework that balances the relative marginal returns from the multiple determinants of health. (Kindig, 1997)

# **Population Health Other Definitions**

*   A commitment to provide the highest quality care, including an ideal experience, for a specific population of patients, at the lowest appropriate cost

*   Improving outcomes requires:

*   best practices
*   analytics
*   adoption

## Burton

# **What is Population Health?**

*   Population Health focuses on:

*   Evidence-based practices, i.e., following clinical practice guidelines
*   Ensuring safe, effective care, i.e., using analytics
*   Transforming care delivery to ensure quality outcomes, i.e., adoption

## Burton

# **Population vs. Public Health**

## **According to the Royal Australian College of General Practice**

## **Population health is:**

*   Prevention of illness, injury and disability
*   Reduction in the burden of illness and rehabilitation of those with a chronic disease

*   Incorporates the social, cultural and political determinants of health

## https://curriculum.racgp.org.au/media/12302/populationhealthandpublichealth.pdf

# **Population vs. Public Health, cont’d.**

*   Public health represents the official programs, processes, and procedures organized by a government to protect, promote and when necessary restore people’s health
*   Population health and public health are the combination of sciences, skills and beliefs directed to the maintenance and improvement of the health of all people through collective or social actions

## https://curriculum.racgp.org.au/media/12302/populationhealthandpublichealth.pdf

# **Population vs. Public Health, cont’d.**

*   Public health is dedicated to promoting healthy lifestyles, protecting society from environmental hazards, infectious diseases, and natural disasters

*   Promotes healthcare parity, quality, and accessibility
*   Protects the health of entire populations
*   Education is a key focus of the field

*   Population health refers to the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group. (Kindig) It is comprised of three main modules: health outcomes, health determinants, and policies (Nash DB)

# **Population Health Improvement**

*   Population health improvement infers the existence of:

*   Health outcomes
*   Behaviors, and
*   Determinants of health that can be:

*   Measured
*   Tracked
*   Reviewed to ensure optimal health status for a designated population
